# CECS-378-Cryptography-LAB
A python program that will attempt a brute-force decryption attack on an encrypted phrase that uses the simple substitution cypher. 
Uses a caesar cipher to decrypt the first two cipher texts and a hill climbing quadgram algorithm for the last two ciphers.

Must decrypt these cipher texts
